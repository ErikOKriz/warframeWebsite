- Let's assume there is a time of around 5.5 minutes to get a drop of void traces
    - I say around 1.5 minutes of set up from the end of one mission to the start of another
    - and an average of 4 minutes between each drop once the mission starts

- Let's also assume an average 18.75 void traces per drop (open to interpretation)

- You need 100 void traces per radiant relic, since you get traces for breaking the relic you're trying to farm, you need 100 traces for the initial relic, + 81.25 traces for each subsequent relic. I think it's safe to assume that each person has at least 18.75 traces. 
    - It's worth check out if a flawless relic is worth it to farm an uncommon drop, will have to compare time to farm a new relic and farming more traces to the increase in chance you get from a radiant relic

- So it takes 81.25 traces for each radient relic or 81.25traces/18.75 traces/drops * 5.5 minutes = 23.83 minutes to farm up void traces
    - 31.25 relics for flawless. 31.25/18.75 * 5.5 = 9.16667 minutes to farm up void traces
    - 1.833 minutes to farm traces for an exceptional relic (probably never worth it but maybe in fringe case it could be fastest)

- This info is with no modifiers, such modifiers being having a booster to drops to double the rate at which void traces drop and the kavat mod which help with drops.
Maybe we need a checkbox to see if you're farming with either of these active. Need to do the math for either and both of these active based on these checks.
    - Also note that radsharing (or I guess flawless sharing) lessens the average time to get a radient relic by a factor of 0.33 assuming you do everything with the same 3 other guys and there's no time taken to form a group.

- Note: It' sworth noting that ther are endless nodes which may drop 2 relics the user is looking for at different rarities. In such a case the time it takes to get A drops goes up because they won't quit once they get to the second A, this has to be factored in if the mission dorps another relic the user wants at B drop or C drop. The same is true for B drop relics if user needs a B and C drop relic from a node. 

- Example Math: Assume a rare drop from a relic dropping from a survival mission at rotation A with an 11.06% chance of dropping. 5.75 minutes per drop * 1/.1106 ~= 52 minutes to aquire a relic on average. 23.83 minutes to farm void traces and 5.5 minutes to crack the relic. So that's 52 + 23.83 + 5.5 = 81.33 minutes per radiant relic cracked done solo. Without a radshare this would take an average of 813.3 minutes in order to get that part at a 10% drop chance from the relic.

Survival- 
    - Assume 1.5 minutes of setup before mission starts
    A drops - 1.5 + 10 minutes for 2 drops = 11.5/2 minutes per drop = 5.75 minutes per A drop. Probably not worth going to 25 minutes unless after a B or C drop form the same node.
    B drops - 1.5 + 15 = 16.5 minutes per drop 
    C drops - 21.5 minutes per drop

Capture
    - Let's assume it takes .5 minutes to set up and start a mission and 3 minutes on average. So the average run takes 3.5 minutes per drop

Exterminate
    - .5 minutes set up
    - 5 minutes average time
    - 5.5 minutes per drop

Defence
    - 1.5 minutes set up + time for people to join lobby
    - 6 minutes per 5 waves* 
        - A drop - 1.5 + 12 minutes for 2 drops
            - 13.5/2 = 6.75 minutes per drop
        - B drop 1.5 + 18 minutes per drop = 19.5 minutes/ drop
        - C drop 1.5 + 24 = 25.5 minutes / drop

Interception
    - taking info from the wiki, double check time per round number, seems too long to get to a C drop
    - 1.5 minutes set up
    - 3.25 minututes per round assuming less than perfect time of 3 minutes
        - A drop 1.5 + 32.5 minutes for 2 drops = 34/2 = 17 min/drop
        - B drop 1.5 + 15*3.25 = 50.25 minutes per drop
        - C drop 1.5 + 20*3.25 = 66.5 minutes/ drop

Excavation
    - 1.5 minute set up
    - 1.25 minutes per digger (assuming there's overlap time for diggers)
    - need 2 diggers to get a drop
        - A drop 1.5 + 5 minutes for 2 drops = 6.5/2 = 3.25 minutes per A drop
        - B drops = 1.5 + 7.5 minutes = 9 minutes per drop
        - C drop = 1.5 + 10 minutes = 11.5 minutes per drop

Spy
    - In the database, when defining rotation A,B, and C, A means one data vault opened, B means two and C means 3.
    - take probably around 3 minutes just to run the full length of mission, plus a static amount of time to run a vault
    - Let's assume that the time to run an average vault is 3 minutes. Some time for getting to the vault from the path to extraction, and some time to creack the vault and leave (This is total speculation and is up for debate).    
    - Assume 2 players in a mission, or assuming that one vault's worht of time needs to be done at A drop, since literally one needs to be opened, one vault's time for a B drop since each player is doing one, and 2 vault's time for a C drop since one person will have to do two and the other person will have to wait for that person to get to the end anyway.
        - The reason I say that the assumtion is 2 people running instead of 3 or 4 is that in my experience, outside of sorties some people just don't want to do the vaults and leave them to others, so on average I think that 2 people activly working on vault cracking is a good average, with longer times coming from some idle time possibly assuming someone is running a vault when they're not (Feel free to debate this).
    - So, 
        - A drops 1.5 + 3 + 3 = 7.5 minutes per drop
        - B drops = 1.5 + 3 + 2*3 = 10.5 min/drop
        - C drops = 13.5 min/drop

Mobile Defence
    - Need to defend 2-3 terminals for a set time to complete objective. 
        - What is that set time?
    - add time to run mission


Exterminate
    - 6 minutes to run mission
    - 1.5 set up
    - 7.5 minutes per drop

Skirmish
    - No real clue. 
        - Let's just call it an average of 10 minutes per drop (seems reasonable?)
