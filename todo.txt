-Get Luca up to speed on github, and Python if he wants

-Get the website on to github, and clone it to my PC

-learn how merging works with github, merge luca's website files and my .py files into the master branch

-Once website has a workable format (now?), start working on how to integrate database.txt as a database for the site

-Work through getting relics into their own database, should be able to pull drop tables for each relic and 
    drop tables which drop the relic

-Make sure the main program (and the url generator/goFetch, everything really) is set up to handle relics as well

-Make a function that is able to access mission type pages(capture, exterminate, etc.)
    , and be able to construct a list of all missions of a certain type and tier or planet. In order to oconstruct a 
    full drop table for the relics, where you have every mission listed that drops the relic, and its drop rates for 
    that relic 
-set of all missions set(capture, defense, excavation, exterminate, mobile defense, survival, disruption, Empyrean,
    interception, onslaught, rush, sabotage, spy, salvage, profit-taker bounty, pursuit, assassination, arena, assault,
    hijack, infested salvage, junction, rescue, skirmish)
        - add more if needed
    - some of these missions have identical info within their respective html files, but some are different. So we need to 
        typecode it out by info sorting style, not type by type.

- Set up main function to handle mission info as well. decide if we are going to add the relic/ mission info into the main 
    database or if we are going to use multiple databases for different types of data.

-Once the mission sort is complete, try combining all the html parsers into one large one. Since they all find the info in 
    the same way, just with different keywords, you can have one function that finds the keyword lines and then sends each 
    line to a helper funciton which knows what to do with important lines. This fucntions will need to have typecodes to 
    determine what the keywords and what helper functions to use in the for loop. below is the list of the types we will use,
    and we'll need a helper function for each.
        -list[warframe, weapon, relic, list[missoin types], companion] 
            - I'm assuming prime companions have a different info sort than weapons or waframe, haven't checked it out though.
                if they have the same sorting style, companion can also fit into the weapon or warframe typecode. 
            - For each group of mission types above that share a sorting style, we will need a typecode and a helper function. 
                Probably just called mission1(line), mission2(line), etc. with a comment telling which mission types it handles.
