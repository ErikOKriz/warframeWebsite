-Get Luca up to speed on github, and Python if he wants

-Get the website on to github, and clone it to my PC

-learn how merging works with github, merge luca's website files and my .py files into the master branch

-Once website has a workable format (now?), start working on how to integrate database.txt as a database for the site

-Work through getting relics into their own database, should be able to pull drop tables for each relic and 
    drop tables which drop the relic

-Make sure the main program (and the url generator/goFetch, everything really) is set up to handle relics as well

-Once you get the relic search going, make the function able to access mission type pages(capture, exterminate, etc.)
    , and be able to construct a list of all missions of a certain type and tier or planet. In order to oconstruct a 
    full drop table for the relics, where you have every mission listed that drops the relic, and its drop rates for 
    that relic
