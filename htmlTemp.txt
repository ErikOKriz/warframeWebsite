As a Prime Warframe, Atlas Prime possesses a special passive ability where contact with an Orokin Void Death Orb will make them release an energy pulse that grants 250 Energy to all nearby allies. This effect can only occur once per Death Orb, and can occur even if the Death Orb has been previously destroyed.
Atlas Prime's earthly elemental constructs feature alternate appearances:
Atlas Prime's  Tectonics rock wall has a slightly darker color and features additional gold ore veins and cracks that glow with an orange lava color.
Atlas Prime's  Rumblers are formed by a solid, dense, and uniform rock formation, as opposed to looser and irregular rock for his non-Primed counterpart, featuring Atlas Prime's chosen primary color and cracks that glow with chosen emissive colors. The Rumblers also have gold ornaments on their torsos and knuckles, resembling those on Atlas Prime himself.
The Rumblers will retain its appearance if a player choose to equip non-Prime default skin. However, equipping other skins will still change Rumblers' appearance accordingly.



TriviaEdit
Atlas Prime is the first Primed Warframe to have five enhanced stats over his regular counterpart.
Atlas Prime's helmet design resembles the Cyclopes, giant one-eyed creatures in Greek mythology, symbolizing his immense strength.
Atlas Prime is the fourth Primed Warframe whose non-primed variant was unlockable through a quest (The Jordas Precept), after  Mirage,  Limbo and  Chroma.
Before his global debut, Atlas Prime was first announced during TennoVip 2019 at Tokyo Game Show.
Atlas Prime's Rumblers were dubbed Prime Rumblers in a Twitter post by [DE]Rebecca
